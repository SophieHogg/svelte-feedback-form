# Svelte Feedback Form

A feedback form made with Svelte (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I made this as a personal project 20-21/10/2022.

This project was based on this YouTube tutorial by Traversy Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TVy6GdtNuQ
I made sure to modify some elements and the colour palette but since I'm just getting started with Svelte it is quite similar.

### MVP:

-   Create a feedback form
-   Display feedback with rating
-   Ability to delete feedback
    -   this would not be ideal in a legitimate review context but since this project doesn't have a backend it is simply a basic demonstration of Svelte)
-   Ability to create new feedback
-   Number of reviews and average score displayed
-   Simple animations for reviews being created and deleted

### Next Steps for Svelte

-   A notepad app that works similarly to this one. This will be my opportunity to strike out on my own, albeit using this project as a base.
-   More usage of Svelte's inbuilt libraries
-   More usage of transitions
